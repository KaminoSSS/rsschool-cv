#### About

My goal is to be a frontend developer. I am not satisfied with my current job due to the lack of career growth and working conditions.

#### Skills

* CSS
* HTML
* Basic JavaSkript
* Basic Git

#### Code example

Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

```
function squareSum(numbers){
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0;i < numbers.length;i++){
    sum += numbers[i]**2
  }
  return sum
}

```
